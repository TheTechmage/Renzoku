renzoku (0.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is the first official realease which upstream thinks is somewhat stable.
  Between version 0.1.0 and 0.1.1, there have been changes involving how
  subprocesses are launched and managed. In version 0.1.0, there were issues
  where the build steps were run twice in a row. Now, in version 0.1.1, build
  and test steps are merely run once. Besides the way processes are managed,
  there have been a few infrastructure changes that will be exposed in a future
  release. For example, the ability to log to a file instead of standard output
  is possible, but it has yet to be exposed.
